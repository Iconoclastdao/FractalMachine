# 🧬 Proprietary Method Declaration

## This software implements a novel architecture based on:

## Fractal Time Partitioning + Signal Pulse Emission

# This means:
## Time is divided into dynamic subframes (“fractals”) that determine when and how signals are fired.
## Agents (“pulses”) respond based not only on time, but on phase-aligned fractal logic.
## This creates a non-linear, sovereign, adaptive computational system.

# This method is proprietary and covered under the terms of this license. Any commercial use of this method or derivatives must be licensed.
