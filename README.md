## 🌐 What Is This?

A novel time-fractal-based pulse signaling architecture enabling distributed agents to:

- Fire signals on fractional subframes of time
- Modulate behavior across evolving intervals
- Self-evolve using an immune-style logic
- Break linear-time logic for distributed autonomy

This is not just code — it’s the **first covenantal signaling mesh** for sovereign human-AI cooperation.
